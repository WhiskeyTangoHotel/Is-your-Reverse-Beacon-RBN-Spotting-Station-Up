Project details and code at:

If you are running or monitoring a RBN skimmer/reporting station knowing if the system is 
reporting information (spots) to the central service is information you want.   
Most of these stations are "just running happily in the background" and the operator 
running the station may not know it is down.  So, ee created a Python script to send 
an email if a skimmer you own or monitor is down.
